### 📘 Description
The Timeline Component is an interactive scheduling interface designed to visualize project progress and task dependencies in an intuitive way. It provides a structured view of tasks across different teams—Frontend, Backend, Design, and Testing—allowing clear visibility of workflow and timelines.

Built using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, the component dynamically adjusts to different view modes (day, week, month) and offers zoom and “scroll to today” functionality. Each task bar visually represents duration and progress, while dependencies are drawn with connection lines to maintain logical task flow.

The design focuses on simplicity and professionalism, incorporating gradients, smooth animations, and responsive behavior. The integrated Task Detail Sidebar allows users to edit or review task details in real-time, ensuring the timeline remains a single source of truth for planning and execution.
